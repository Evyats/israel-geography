Summarize israel geography game



lets add some more things.
the difficulty - i want a slider of diffuculty but not a continuous one, it has like segments when you move it where each segment makes it harder (first segment - 10 cities, second 20, third 30, 40, 50, and then jumps of 30 more cities in each segment).
in the segments when you choose which cities to add - add also the palestinian ones. so when we turn off that palestinian option, we might not see these clean jumps.
add them by size of city as in the json - meaning the first ones are the biggest and so on. 
dont remove the easy medium hard buttons from the code but lets hide them for now.
do the segments definition "hardcoded" meaning add them to the catalog, dont write algorithm that looks at all available and define the segments when launching the game.
also - lets change how the levels catalog works - i want that every hardder segment / level will automatically include all easier ones, so we wont have these duplications.
add another levels catalog files for this segmentaiton difficulty method.
when jumping in that slider between segments we see the map updated accordingly same as happening now in the difficulty buttons.
do you understand what im asking here for? do you have questions?
